# Feedback on the Guidlines and Associated Task

## Task Description

Task description is thorough, and therefore it was easy to do. The guidelines
are simple and easy to follow.

## Task setup

The current task setup (the format of annotation) is rather cumbersome for
manual annotation. Each excel column occupies the entire page width and
since this is a comparison task, that makes it difficult to get used to after
a while. I should think that this can also increase annotator fatigue. 

Suggestion: I believe that instead of comma separated columns, they should be
individual rows. Comparing the sentences when placed next to each other in
different lines makes it easier to view the differences and easier to annotate.

For example:
File: A.txt
Text_A: The world is a mighty beautiful place.
Text_B: The world is a mighty beautiful place for creatures like us.
Question_1: For whom is the world a mighty beautiful place?
Question_2:
reason_no_question:

## Guidelines

I have observed a common trend in the reason_no_question annotation that the
current guidelines don't cover, which is "No additional information in text_b,
the two texts are just semantically different". For example:

Text_A: I enjoy eating cherries.
Text_B: I enjoy eating bananas.

These two sentences are just different, and this occurs a large number of times
so maybe it could be added into the reason_no_question list?
